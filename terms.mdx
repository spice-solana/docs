Terms and Conditions for Liquidity Protocol
Effective Date: 11-28-2024
Last Updated: 11-28-2024
By participating in our liquidity provision protocol (the "Protocol"), you agree to the following terms and conditions (the "Terms"). Please read them carefully, as they outline important information about your rights, obligations, and potential risks.
1. Acceptance of Terms
By interacting with the Protocol, providing liquidity, or using any services we offer, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the Protocol.
2. Nature of the Protocol
The Protocol enables users to supply liquidity to token pools in exchange for rewards or a share of transaction fees. The functionality of the Protocol relies on blockchain technology, smart contracts, and third-party decentralized systems.
3. Assumption of Risk
By providing liquidity to the Protocol, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:
3.1. Smart Contract Risks
The Protocol operates using smart contracts deployed on a blockchain. While we strive to ensure the security of these contracts, there is a risk of vulnerabilities, bugs, or exploits that could lead to partial or total loss of your funds.
3.2. Market and Volatility Risks
Cryptocurrencies and digital assets are highly volatile. Price swings can result in rapid losses, and you may lose the value of your provided liquidity in part or in full.
3.3. Liquidity Risks
In cases of extreme market conditions or significant withdrawals from the pool, there may be insufficient liquidity to redeem your assets promptly or at expected rates.
3.4. Regulatory Risks
Your participation in the Protocol may be subject to local laws or regulations. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
3.5. Protocol Changes or Failures
The Protocol's functionality may be affected by software updates, governance decisions, or unforeseen technical issues, potentially impacting your liquidity provision.
4. No Guarantee of Returns
The Protocol does not guarantee any returns on liquidity provision. Rewards, if any, are subject to market conditions, pool activity, and other factors beyond our control.
5. User Responsibilities
5.1. Due Diligence
You are responsible for conducting your own research and understanding the risks before interacting with the Protocol.
5.2. Private Key Management
You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys and wallet credentials. Loss of access to your wallet may result in the permanent loss of your assets.
5.3. Compliance
You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including those related to taxes, reporting, and regulations in your jurisdiction.
6. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
The Protocol and its developers, contributors, or affiliates shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential losses, including but not limited to impermanent loss, token devaluation, or smart contract exploits.
All interactions with the Protocol are at your own risk.
7. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Protocol and its team from any claims, damages, losses, or liabilities arising from your use of the Protocol or any breach of these Terms.
8. Protocol Governance
Certain aspects of the Protocol may be governed by decentralized voting or community governance. By participating in governance, you agree to be bound by the outcomes of such decisions.
9. Termination and Updates
We reserve the right to modify or terminate these Terms or any aspect of the Protocol at any time. Continued use of the Protocol after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
